Effectively all tasks throughout this project iteration were completed in a group, together. 
Meaning, regardless of it being Test definition, execution or the development of the 
implementation, each group member work together in each of these deliverables. Hence, 
it's difficult to pinpoint exactly who is responsible for a given file. 

If it's absolutely necessary to attribute who did particular tasks, here's the breakdown.

Code Implementation / Design : Jayven Larsen, Aj Donald 
Unit Test Development : Adam Sultan, David Hos
UML/State Diagrams: Aj Donald, Sami Kasouha
Validation & Verification (debugging and testing): David Hos, Jayven Larsen, Adam Sultan
